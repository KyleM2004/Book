            Scarlet sunlight was repelled by the shifting scales of the cyan sea; looping back to shine a bloody light upon the profitable port city of Eventide, highlighting 
            the deep alleyways and darkened holes that the fell and the unfortunate dwell within. Inside one of the deeper dens of depravity, a smuggler approached a table with 
            a hand of dice. The table had tucked itself into the furthest right corner from the entrance of the full square room it was stuck in, seemingly in a vain attempt to 
            distance itself from its hectic surroundings infested with lowlifes. Glancing around the room one could see nothing but bare wooden supports stopping the dirt and 
            rock from collapsing back into its rightful place. Decoration was sparse, save for the odd head of a beast such as the bulls that glared balefully from above the 
            centre of the bar running the length of the right side of the room. Presumably, no-one had seen fit to add any furnishings, perhaps on the belief that the den would 
            be found and razed by the local authorities. From the depths of his hat, the Smuggler had spied a strange trio sitting silently at this table far in the corner and 
            decided to try his hand at swindling them out of whatever pathetic savings they had left. From looks alone, they would be worth very little.

            The human that sat in the middle of his companions wore naught but scraps of fabric and leather that covered a stout yet deathly frail frame of a body. His hair was 
            greasy and thick, alive and puppeted by all sorts of insects as it slumped over his slate gray eyes fixed on a point in the middle of the room. Despite his 
            raggedness, there was an insistent tugging at the edges of the smugglers brain; A smidgen of... something he couldn't quite place. Shrugging it off as merely the 
            amount of alcohol racing through his system, he continued his spying. Quivering to the humans left was an odd creature, one not even the smuggler recognised, 
            covered in matted, dark blue fur and possessing whiskers sprouting from a distinct snout and shiny, verdant eyes glimmered from deep within its skull that skittered
            and jittered about the room in profound fear, looking undeniably verminous. Yet again, something tugged lightly on the recesses of his mind and, yet again, 
            the smuggler disregarded it. A being residing in Eventide without being known to the smuggler was a rare thing indeed; so prolific and diverse was his 'business' 
            that it made him pause and re-appraise his idea of challenging the trio with such an unknown present.. Unfortunately, his hunger pangs and lust for more liqour 
            fuelled his desperation for coin, and he disregarded this silly notion. Casting his eyes back to the table, his eyes fell upon he last companion slumped to the 
            humans left. Knife-shaped ears gave away the fact it was an elf and they fared little better than their counterparts, clothed, as they were, in a simple, tarnished 
            robe barely covering their lanky, malnutritioned skeleton of a body. Cascading yet lank silver hair reached its lower back (seemingly covering more than the rag they
            wore ever would) yet clumped awkwardly around its shoulders. The elf gazed around the room with its piercing azure eyes, possibly in an effort to drain all the 
            knowledge it could derive from its surroundings (a typical habit for their kind). Once more, and with more force this time, something rattled around the edges of his 
            mind, something in his subconscious subliminally screaming at him about something he couldn't quite place. An interesting lot to be sure, one he would be more than
            willing to dupe for his benefit.

            <div class="paragraph">
            Triple checking that he truly wanted to attempt his scheme, he roved his eyes over the trio one last time and caught something he hadn't noticed before. On the elf's
            left hand, nursing an empty wooden kuska, was an iridescent ring made of a material resembling wood. A headache started to form behind his eyes. Swiping at them,
            the smuggler successfully smeared the grime and grit in his eyes onto other portions of his face and looked again to the ring. He would truly regret having so much 
            to drink the next day due to the headache and the fact that the ring was just plain oak wood; Nothing strange or special about it, but still worth something if he 
            could pull his little trick off. Dragging himself to his feet, he meandered drunkenly over to the table and scraped a chair over to pull up opposite of the small
            group.<br>
            
            <div class="speech">
            "Strange fellows you are" he managed to drunkenly hiccup out.<br>

            <div class="speech">
            The three spoke back almost as one.<br>

            <div class="speech">
            "No stranger than any other folk you've got scampering around here!" The human vehemenently snapped back in a surprisingly gruff tone while rapidly shifting his 
            slate grey eyes to bore into the smuggler's blue-green ones.<br> 
            </div>

            <div class="speech">
            "Strange fellows all round, it seems..." The elf replied in clipped and measured tones, azure eyes resting on the smuggler for a moment, eliciting a strange sense of 
            being seen through, rather than seen.<br>
            </div>

            <div class="speech">
            "Strange-odd? How dare you, pathetic no-fur" Screeched the rat-creature, verdant eyes bulging somehow even further out of its skull in fear and shock.<br>
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
            Recoiling from the sudden onslaught of their chorus of voices, the smuggler meekly sputtered, unsure of how to reply to such
