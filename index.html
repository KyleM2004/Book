            Scarlet sunlight was repelled by the shifting scales of the cyan sea; looping back to shine a bloody light upon the profitable port city of Eventide, highlighting 
            the deep alleyways and darkened holes that the fell and the unfortunate dwell within. Inside one of the deeper dens of depravity, a smuggler approached a table with 
            a hand of dice. The table had tucked itself into the furthest right corner from the entrance of the full square room it was stuck in, seemingly in a vain attempt to 
            distance itself from its hectic surroundings infested with lowlifes. Glancing around the room one could see nothing but bare wooden supports stopping the dirt and 
            rock from collapsing back into its rightful place. Decoration was sparse, save for the odd head of a beast such as the bulls that glared balefully from above the 
            centre of the bar running the length of the right side of the room. Presumably, no-one had seen fit to add any furnishings, perhaps on the belief that the den would 
            be found and razed by the local authorities.

            From the depths of his hat, the Smuggler had spied a strange trio sitting silently at this table far in the corner and decided to try his hand at swindling them out 
            of whatever pathetic savings they had left. From looks alone, they would be worth very little; the human that sat in the middle of his companions wore naught but 
            scraps of fabric and leather. His hair was greasy and thick, alive and puppeted by all sorts of insects as it slumped over his slate gray eyes. Despite his 
            raggedness, there was an insistent tugging at the edges of the smugglers brain; A smidgen of... something he couldn't quite place. Shrugging it off as merely the 
            amount of alcohol racing through his system, he continued his spying. An elf sat to the humans left and fared little better, clothed, as they were, in a simple, 
            tarnished robe.
