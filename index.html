            Scarlet sunlight was repelled by the shifting scales of the cyan sea; looping back to shine a bloody light upon the profitable port city of Eventide, highlighting 
            the deep alleyways and darkened holes that the fell and the unfortunate dwell within. Inside one of the deeper dens of depravity, a smuggler approached a table with 
            a hand of dice. The table had tucked itself into the furthest right corner from the entrance of the full square room it was stuck in, seemingly in a vain attempt to 
            distance itself from its hectic surroundings infested with lowlifes. Glancing around the room one could see nothing but bare wooden supports stopping the dirt and 
            rock from collapsing back into its rightful place. Decoration was sparse, save for the odd head of a beast such as the bulls that glared balefully from above the 
            centre of the bar running the length of the right side of the room. Presumably, no-one had seen fit to add any furnishings, perhaps on the belief that the den would 
            be found and razed by the local authorities. From the depths of his hat, the Smuggler had spied a strange trio sitting silently at this table far in the corner and 
            decided to try his hand at swindling them out of whatever pathetic savings they had left. From looks alone, they would be worth very little.

            The human that sat in the middle of his companions wore naught but scraps of fabric and leather that covered a 
            stout yet deathly frail frame of a body. His hair was greasy and thick, alive and puppeted by all sorts of insects as it slumped over his slate gray eyes fixed on a 
            point in the middle of the room. Despite his raggedness, there was an insistent tugging at the edges of the smugglers brain; A smidgen of... something he couldn't 
            quite place. Shrugging it off as merely the amount of alcohol racing through his system, he continued his spying. Quivering to the humans left was an odd creature, 
            one not even the smuggler recognised, covered in matted, dark blue fur and possessing whiskers sprouting from a distinct snout and shiny, verdant eyes glimmered 
            from deep within its skull that skittered and jittered about the room in profound fear, looking undeniably verminous. It was rare when a being could reside in 
            Eventide without being known to the smuggler, so prolific and diverse was his 'business', that it made him pause and re-appraise his idea of challenging the trio 
            with such an unknown present. Unfortunately, his hunger pangs and lust for more liqour fuelled his desperation for coin, and he disregarded this silly notion. 
            Casting his eyes back to the table, his eyes fell upon the last companion slumped to the humans left. Knife-shaped ears gave away the fact it was an elf and they
            fared little better than their counterparts, clothed, as they were, in a simple, tarnished robe barely covering their lanky, malnutritioned skeleton of a body. 
            Cascading yet lank silver hair reached its lower back(seemingly covering more than the rag they wore ever would) yet clumped awkwardly around its shoulders. The elf 
            gazed around the room with its piercing azure eyes, possibly in an effort to drain all the knowledge it could from its surroundings (a typical habit for their kind).
